ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Carmel-Jane

I'm a Northcoders Student and aspiring full stack junior software engineer.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

- **Maltese Dictionary**

- **Coffee Connoisseur App and Api**: A mobile application that allows users to search for coffee shops near them on a map and collect beans as a reward system. Users can leave reviews for the coffee shops, and post pictures of their coffee onto the coffee shop page. Check out the API here and the app here.

- **CJ News**: A social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website (utilises the Northcoders News API that I built)

- **Northcoders News API**: Reproducing the building of a real-world backend service (such as Reddit).

Stay tuned for many more to come...
